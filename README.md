## Description

Poor Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WaSH) during birth can lead to infections that cause long term maternal health issues. WaSH conditions during birth do not only affect the health of the mother, but also the health of the newborn child. Infections such as sepsis, tetanus, pneumonia, and diarrhea which account for a substantial proportion of deaths of newborns are attributed to the WaSH conditions in which children are born. Although the  importance of quality WaSH is well documented, many studies have found insufficient coverage and inadequate quality of WaSH in maternal wards. Many maternity wards in Sub-Saharan Africa use rain water stored in tanks for days or months from where it gets contaminated. The main objective of this project is to design and implement a smart water tank that purifies water while continuously monitoring water quality and quantity. This system needs to be effective in maintaining a high level of WaSH standards while optimizing energy usage. The water tank is planned to be installed at Ssekanyonyi Healthcare Center IV in Ugandaâ€™s Mityana District, and the data from the tank will be sent to a cloud server for analysis and storage. This project is one component of a larger project which leverages the power of Internet of Things, Big Data, Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence to improve maternal health in Sub-Saharan Africa through improved WaSH.

## Problem Statement

The objective of the WaSH Smart Tank project is to develop an end-to-end water filtration system that monitors water level and quality using IoT technologies. The filtration system itself should mostly be passive, requiring minimal power to operate. The system filter should have a very long lifespan of at least 5+ years, and require little to no regular maintenance. Water output from the system should have a turbidity 1 - 5 NTU. The filtered water should be sufficiently chlorinated to remove pathogens and extend storage time. Filtered water should also be mostly tasteless to be acceptable for drinking. The digital components of the system should be interfaced using Arduino microcontrollers. These microcontrollers should be able to collect level and quality measurements before and after the filtration. This data will then be sent to the cloud server for processing. The system should also have a simple interface for basic operation and viewing collected data. The system as a whole should require little to no training for operation and maintenance.
